# Movie-Baseline-RS
This is a Baseline Movie RS on movielens 100k dataset.
This Recommender system shows the result for baseline RS for movielens 100k data set with 9742 movies and 610 users.
First I calculate the movies and users biases and then calculate the predicted baseline ratings.
The result shows very good RMSE for this RS.
I appreciate any feedback
